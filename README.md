# Xpress MVC for WordPress

If you ever wanted to code in a MVC pattern inside WordPress, now you can!

Using this plugin, you can create controllers (with the same syntax of the WP REST API) that process each request and respond it using a normal WordPress template.

Check our [example](https://github.com/xpress-framework/xpress-mvc-example).
